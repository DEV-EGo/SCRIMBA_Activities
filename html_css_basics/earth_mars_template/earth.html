    <h1>Earth</h1>

    <p>
      Earth is <strong>the third planet from the Sun</strong>, and
      <strong>the only astronomical object known to harbor life</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
    <h3>Rotation</h3>
    <p>
      Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400
      seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds). Because Earth's solar
      day is now <em>slightly</em> longer than it was during the 19th century
      due to tidal deceleration,
      <strong>each day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer</strong>.

    <p>
      Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the
      main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at
      a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is
      equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two
      minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon
      are approximately the same.M
